# AWS infrastructure made using Terraform

Terraform module containing the resources needed to automate the deployment of a web server on AWS. Including:
 * [VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/vpc) 
 * [Internet Gateway](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/internet_gateway)
 * [Custom Route Table](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/route_table)
 * [Subnet](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/subnet)
 * [Security Group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/security_group)
 * [Network interface](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/network_interface)
 * [Elastic IP](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/eip) assigned to the Network Interface
 * [Ubuntu server](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance) (including apache2)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

An AWS account is mandatory, as we're gonna deploy this infrastructure on... AWS :)  If you already have one you can [Sign In](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home), otherwise you still can [create a new AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start)

### Installing Terraform on Ubuntu

Please run the commands below to get and install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) on Ubuntu

```
sudo apt-get install unzip
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.13.3/terraform_0.13.3_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_0.13.3_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
ls /usr/local/bin/
```

Check if Terraform is now successfully installed by running:

```
terraform --version
# should return:
# Terraform v0.13.3
```

## Deployment

This part is gonna focus on how to deploy the project on a live system.
Once Terraform is successfully installed and you have access to your AWS account, let's clone the repository and deploy the project :


```
git clone https://github.com/Cedric-M/terraform-aws-infrastructure.git
```

Once you cloned the git repository, you need to create an AWS Access Key:

>Get the keys from console.aws.amazon.com/iam > security credentials > Access Keys

Add them to the `terraform.tfvars` file as follow:


```
aws_access_key = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
aws_secret_key = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

### Launching procedure

Once your keys are setup, all you have to do is to use the following commands:

```
terraform init                        #Initialize a Terraform working directory
terraform apply                       #Builds or changes infrastructure
```

> Tips, to avoid writing manually "yes" each time you run terraform apply, use:

```
terraform apply --auto-approve 
```

If the AWS infrastructure successfully build, you should see the following message in the terminal:

> Apply complete! Resources: 9 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
>
> Outputs:
>
> server_public_ip = 34.206.249.94

note: the public IP address will automatically be generated at each deployment, so it may vary.

You can now access it from your favorite web browser at the address shown :

### Shutdown procedure

In order to shut down the infrastructure we made, (also, not to use too much resource of you are using AWS Free Tier), you can run the following command once you are done:

```
terraform destroy --auto-approve      #Destroy Terraform-managed infrastructure
```

### Supervision procedure

```
terraform state list                  #Advanced state management: show all running instances  
                                      #(make sure you ran terraform apply before)
terraform state show <ressource_name> # Show details about a specific ressource

```

### SSH procedure

#### Create an EC2 Key Pair


> Remember to choose AZ (Availability Zone) first, in our case: us-east-1

This key is going to allow us to connect our server once we deploy it

1. Go to `console.aws.amazon.com/ec2` > Networks & Security > Key Pairs
2. Choose `.pem` file format, for instance, name it `aws-ec2-main-key` 


#### To access your instance:

1. Open an terminal (if you are using windows, find out how to [connect using PuTTY](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html?icmpid=docs_ec2_console))
2. Locate your private key file: `aws-ec2-main-key.pem`.
3. Your key must not be publicly viewable for SSH to work. Use this command if needed:
 
```
    chmod 400 aws-ec2-main-key.pem
```

4. Connect to your instance using its Elastic IP: `34.206.249.94`


Example:
    
```
ssh -i "aws-ec2-main-key.pem" ubuntu@34.206.249.94
```
